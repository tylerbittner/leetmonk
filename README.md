# LeetMonk

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/tylerbittner/leetmonk)](https://github.com/tylerbittner/leetmonk/releases/latest)

**Offline algorithm practice — no account, no internet, no distractions.**

> I was heading camping for the weekend with no cell service, just wildflowers and stars. I didn't want to break my algo streak so I built an app to practice offline! 🏕️ 🤓

Curated problems across arrays, strings, binary search, sliding window, two pointers, stack, heap, dynamic programming, and backtracking. Write Python 3 solutions in a Monaco editor, run them against test cases locally, and track your progress.

> **Note:** Python 3 is the only supported language at this time.

## Features

- **35 curated problems** spanning 9 categories (easy / medium / hard)
- **Monaco editor** with Python syntax highlighting and autocompletion
- **Local code execution** via Python 3 — no server, no network
- **Hints and solutions** revealed on demand, per problem
- **Timer**, **focus mode**, **review flagging**, and **session planner**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Cmd+Enter` to run, `Cmd+Shift+Enter` to submit

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) and [Python 3.9+](https://python.org)

### macOS (packaged app)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylerbittner/leetmonk.git
cd leetmonk
npm install
npm run dist
```

Opens `dist/mac-arm64/LeetMonk.app` (Apple Silicon) or `dist/mac/LeetMonk.app` (Intel). Drag to `/Applications` to install.

> **Note:** The app is unsigned. On first launch macOS will block it — click **Done**, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **"Open Anyway"**. On older macOS, right-click the app → Open works instead.

### All platforms (run from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylerbittner/leetmonk.git
cd leetmonk
npm install
npm run dev
```

Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Electron and Python 3 must be available.

## Adding Problems

Drop a `.json` file into `data/problems/` following the existing schema, then restart. Validate with:

```bash
npm run test:problems
```
